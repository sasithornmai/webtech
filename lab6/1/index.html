    <h2>Programming languages</h2>
    <p>A programming language is any set of rules that converts strings, or graphical 
        program elements in the case of visual programming languages, to various kinds 
        of machine code output.[citation needed] Programming languages are one kind of 
        computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.</p>

        <p>A computer programming language is a language used to write computer programs, 
            which involves a computer performing some kind of computation or algorithm and 
            possibly control external devices such as printers, disk drives, robots, and so on. </p>

        <p>may describe computation on some, possibly abstract, machine. It is generally accepted that 
            a complete specification for a programming language includes a description, possibly idealized, 
            of a machine or processor for that language.</p>

        <p>Programming languages usually contain abstractions for defining and manipulating data structures 
            or controlling the flow of execution. The practical necessity that a programming language support 
            adequate abstractions is expressed by the abstraction principle.</p>
